#####################SubD_blenderAddon#####################

Installation:
1. Download the zip file from the Github repository and extract the contents
2. In Blender, Go to edit > preferences > addons and click the "Install.." button
3. Navigate to the SubD_toggle.py file and click the "Install Add-on"
4. You will have to go to the Blender Keymap settings and disable the all "4" keymaps, as this is the key I am using for the addon and it will not work unless you do so

How to use:
1. I set up the default hotkey to be "4"
2. When you toggle on the subD it will add a Subsurface modifier to the selected mesh and set it to preview level "2"
3. When you toggle it again it will delete the modifier

Troubleshooting:
1. You can't just install the addon as a .zip file, you need to unzip it first
2. Make sure you disabled all the other keymaps that were bound the the "4" key or else the addon wont be triggered with the "4" key press
