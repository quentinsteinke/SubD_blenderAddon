Installation:
	1. Download the zip file from the Github repository
	2. In Blender, Go to edit > preferences > addons and click the "Install.." button

How to use:
	I set up the default hotkey to be "4"
	When you toggle on the subD it will add a Subsurface modifier to the selected mesh and set it to preview level "2"
	When you toggle it again it will delete the modifier
